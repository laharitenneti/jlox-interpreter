# jlox Interpreter (Java)

Implementation of the Lox interpreter in Java, following the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom.  

## Progress
- **Complete**
- Extensions I've added: Arrays/lists, for-in loops

## Notes
- This repo is part of my self-study journey in programming languages and compilers.
- I’ve blogged my progress, insights from each phase, and the rationale behind my custom extensions [here.](https://dev.to/lahari_tenneti_4a8a082e9c/series/33287)
