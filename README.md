# jlox Interpreter (Java)

Implementation of the Lox interpreter in Java, following the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom.  

## Progress
- Added support for blocks, variables, and assignment.
- Need to work on loops and logical operators next.

## Notes
This repo is part of my self-study journey in programming languages and compilers.
