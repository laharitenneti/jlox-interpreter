# jlox Interpreter (Java)

Implementation of the Lox interpreter in Java, following the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom.  

## Progress
- Added support for classes and inheritance.
- Extensions I'm planning to add: Arrays/lists, for-in loops

## Notes
This repo is part of my self-study journey in programming languages and compilers.
